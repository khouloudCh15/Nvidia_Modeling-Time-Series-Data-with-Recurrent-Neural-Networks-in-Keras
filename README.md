# Nvidia_Modeling-Time-Series-Data-with-Recurrent-Neural-Networks-in-Keras

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) allow models to classify or forecast time-series data, like natural language, markets, and even a patientâ€™s health over time. 

I did learn how to:

Create training and testing datasets using electronic health records in HDF5 (hierarchical data format version five)

Prepare datasets for use with recurrent neural networks, which allows modeling of very complex data sequences

Construct a Long-Short Term Memory model (LSTM), a specific RNN architecture, using the Keras library running on top of Theano to evaluate model performance against baseline data

Upon completion, I was able to model time-series data using RNNs.
